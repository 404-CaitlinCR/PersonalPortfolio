                Hi, I am currently a student in my first year of computer science at the university of guelph. Aside from coding i have always had an intrest in gaming, art and music. <br>
                I have been playin musical instruments from a very young age and want to be able to be a "one man band", as of right now I know how to play electric guitar, base, and piano. <br>

                My interest for coding stemed from my intrest in games, after taking my first computer science course I loved coding. So far I have been able to learn many different languages. <br>
