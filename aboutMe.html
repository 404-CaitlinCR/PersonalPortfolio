            <h2>Intro:</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am currently a computer science major in my first year of computer science at the university of guelph. Aside from coding i have always had an intrest in gaming, art and music. <br>
                <br>I have been playin musical instruments from a very young age and want to be able to be a "one man band", as of right now I know how to play electric guitar, base, and piano. <br>
                I also have a massive intrest in art and have been given many chances to share my art within my school communites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in coding stemmed from my interest in video games.  After taking my first computer science course in high school, I was hooked.  The most suprising thing for me was how many different languages there are for programming and how important it is to use the right language for the job.
                <br>Coding languages I'm familiar with:
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>css</li>
                <li>python</li>
                <li>java</li>
                <li>c</li>
