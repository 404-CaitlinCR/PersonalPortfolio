            <h2>Intro:</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am currently a first year Computer Science major at the University of Guelph. Aside from coding, I'm intrested in gaming, art and music. <br>
                <br>I have been playing musical instruments from a very young age and want to be able to be a "one man band". As of right now, I know how to play guitar, bass, and piano. <br>
                <br>I also have a massive intrest in art and have been given many chances to share my art within my school communites. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in coding stemmed from my interest in video games.  After taking my first computer science course in high school, I was hooked.  The most surprising thing for me was how many different languages there are for programming and how important it is to use the right language for the job.
                <br>Coding languages I'm familiar with:
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>css</li>
                <li>python</li>
                <li>java</li>
                <li>c</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="career-interest" id="career-interest">
            <h2>Career Interest:</h2>
            <p>I am currently interested in Web design, cybersecurity or ethical hacking, and machine learning.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                For web design, I’m interested in full-stack development as someone who has always loved to create the design aspect or web design is a creating output and allows me to have full control of the 
                aesthetic and layout of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even allowing me to draw and create small aspects of the website. I am excited to expand my knowledge further in back-end 
                development. Becoming more familiar with Python, Node.js and MySQL. <u>My goal is to create a responsive environment that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.</u>

            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                Recently, cybersecurity has piqued my interest. I have enjoyed learning more about how computer systems work as well as how they can break. Additionally, I enjoy a good brain teaser and puzzle and 
                feel as though cybersecurity presents a good challenge of identifying vulnerabilities, securing applications, and a different mindset of thinking. I’m going to expand my knowledge in areas like 
                network security, penetration testing, and digital forensics, and I hope to earn different certifications that will help me with my career in the future. <u>My goal is to contribute to making the digital 
                    space safer by building safer and more secure systems and helping others understand the risks that come with being plugged into the internet.</u>
                
            </p>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5;">
                As the technological world continues to develop AI is becoming increasingly popular. The more I learn about AI, the more interested I become in its ability to produce “novel” solutions to problems and make 
                its decisions. I’m especially interested in the situations where AI can be applied and the types of benefits / insights it can provide. As a student,AI can be a very useful tool when used in the right way. 
                I’m exploring the available tools in Python such as libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to learn how to create my own AI, and I’m excited to incorporate these tools when developing projects 
                that will help others. In the future, I hope to apply these skills into AI-powered projects that will help improve peoples’ quality of life, from personalized learning tools to adaptive health systems. For 
                instance, could an additional AI layer be added to current natural language processing systems to help identify possible mental health issues from interviews between patients and medical professionals or 
                from an analysis of journal entries.

                In high school the school board commissioned me to create a design for Asian heritage month. I got to reveal the art piece and ended up in the paper. <br>

                I completed three SHSM's (specialized high skills majors): 
                <li>Art and Culture</li>
                    <!-- <li style="margin-left: 5%;">This gave me the skills of .....</li> -->
                <li>Information and Communitcation Technology</li>
                    <!-- <li style="margin-left: 5%;">This SHSM gave me hands on experience with building and flying drones. It also provided with the core skills</li> -->

                    <li style="margin-left: 5%;">Giving me to do a duel credit with Seneca collage, and featuring me in an article <a href="https://www.pvnccdsb.on.ca/pvnc-catholics-aviation-and-aerospace-specialist-high-skills-major-program-taking-off/">Link to article</a></li>
                    <!-- <li style="margin-left: 5%;"> 
                        The course I took with Seneca collage gave me insight into how planes are built, how they fly as well as they different ways of radio communication. This provided me with opportunities to interact 
                        with members of the military and pilots giving me insight into their world of work
                    </li>  -->
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the SHSM's I have completed the following certifications:
                    <li>Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Level C - includes automated external defibrillation (AED)</li>
                    <li>Standard First Aid</li>

            <h3>Lego NXT robots:</h3>
            <p>
                During my last year of high school, my Computer Science teacher gave myself and the other girls in her class to organize and even to help inspire other girls in grades 7-8 to join STEM as well as get hands on experience with Lego NXT robots. <br>
                <br>Our goal was to teach them about the important women in STEM and their contributions to the field, the areas it can applied and its benefits. After a short presentation we split the girls into smaller teams who would work together to 
                build robots and the create code for them to help it complete specific challenges.
